# SpringBootPractice
- Built a fitness web application using Springboot and REST api's 
- The project consisted of building an application using an in memory database to using a postgreSQL database using Docker
- The project focused more on backend development and not very much on frontend, the project doesn't have a UI and uses the console to retrieve data.

**What I Learned**
- In this project I got to learn how to configure a SpringBoot project and how the SpringBoot framework works and the tools it uses to make web applications work.
- I learned how to build RESTful APIs and how to test them properly and how to retrieve and send requests to them.
- I learned different Java techniques like lambda expressions and creating annotations and beans.
- Lastly I learned how to test a SpringBoot project using SpringBoots testing library as well as JUnit to test the various parts of a framework.
